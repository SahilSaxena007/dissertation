1\. What areas in my project am I integrating Human In the Loop:

\- model/inference: stage where humans reviews the uncertain predictions

\- Learning/Feedback level: Stage where human corrections update or fine-tune the model



***Understanding STEP 1: Analysis of the Provided AI Code:***



**\*Primary Function\***

-- insights in the current model (Benjamin's code) - what it does well, where it fails, and why

-- 'clinical assessment of the model' before prescribing any human-in-the-loop intervention

-- the outputs of step 1 will become the input knowledge base for step 2-5 (very crucial)



**\*How does it tie into the rest of the project\***

-- Step 2 (identify cases needed for human intervention): find regions of confusion / uncertainty

-- Step 3 (Decision Thresholds): Decide when to route to the clinicians

-- Step 5 (Feedback Incorporation): Knowing which feature or classes are error-prone helps target feedback (collect labels for specific types)

-- Step 6 ( AI only vs HITL Systems): Compare Systems





**\*Understanding STEP 2: \*
-- Decides which cases should go to a clinician because a huam is likely to improve the outcome.**

**-- Output of Step 2 is a calibrated score h(x)∈\[0,1] = P(human adds value | case x).**

**This score drives Step 3’s thresholds/policy, powers Step 5’s review queue, and is the treatment variable in Step 12 (AI-only vs HITL).**
